# Livana — Your Marketplace for Short-Term Rentals

A full‑stack web application, built to provide a smooth experience for booking and hosting unique stays. It connects people who want to rent out their properties (hosts) with travelers looking for short-term accommodations (guests).
The platform is built on trust, using verified identities and guest/host reviews to help users find and book places securely. 
Developed using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and Mapbox, with user authentication, image uploading, geolocation mapping, and CRUD listings.
